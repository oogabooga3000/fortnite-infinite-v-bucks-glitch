<p style="color:lightpurple;">The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in
Heaven knows I tried

Don't let them in
Don't let them see
Be the good girl you always had to be
Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know
Well, now they know

Let it go
Let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go
Let it go
Turn away and slam the door

I don't care
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
(The cold never bothered me anyway)

It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all

It's time to see
What I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free

Let it go
Let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go
Let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on, oh!

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallises like an icy blast
I'm never going back
The past is in the past

Let it go (sing it)
(Let it go)
Can't (hold it back any more)
Let it (go)
(Let it go)
Turn (away and slam the door)
I (don't care what they're going to say)
Let the storm rage on (sing it!)
(The cold never bothered me anyway)

Let it go
Let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go
Let it go
The perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway</p>
