<p style="color:Purple;">The snow glows white on the mountain tonight<br>
Not a footprint to be seen<br>
A kingdom of isolation<br>
And it looks like I'm the queen<br>
<br>
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside<br>
Couldn't keep it in<br>
Heaven knows I tried<br>
<br>
Don't let them in<br>
Don't let them see<br>
Be the good girl you always had to be<br>
Conceal, don't feel<br>
Don't let them know<br>
Well, now they know<br>
<br>
Let it go<br>
Let it go<br>
Can't hold it back anymore<br>
Let it go<br>
Let it go<br>
Turn away and slam the door<br>
<br>
I don't care<br>
What they're going to say<br>
Let the storm rage on<br>
(The cold never bothered me anyway)<br>
<br>
It's funny how some distance<br>
Makes everything seem small<br>
And the fears that once controlled me<br>
Can't get to me at all<br>
<br>
It's time to see<br>
What I can do<br>
To test the limits and break through<br>
No right, no wrong, no rules for me<br>
I'm free<br>
<br>
Let it go<br>
Let it go<br>
I am one with the wind and sky<br>
Let it go<br>
Let it go<br>
You'll never see me<br>
Here I stand and here I'll stay<br>
Let the storm rage on, oh!<br>
<br>
My power flurries through the air into the ground<br>
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around<br>
And one thought crystallises like an icy blast<br>
I'm never going back<br>
The past is in the past<br>
<br>
Let it go<br>
(Let it go)<br>
Can't (hold it back any more)<br>
Let it (go)<br>
(Let it go)<br>
Turn (away and slam the door)<br>
I (don't care what they're going to say)<br>
Let the storm rage on (sing it!)<br>
(The cold never bothered me anyway)<br>
<br>
Let it go<br>
Let it go<br>
And I'll rise like the break of dawn<br>
Let it go<br>
Let it go<br>
The perfect girl is gone<br>
Here I stand in the light of day<br>
Let the storm rage on<br>
The cold never bothered me anyway</p>
